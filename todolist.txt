TO-DO LIST

- double-click to close questions tab on mobile
- links pseudo-class styling
- check what type of errors to send back


APP FINALIZATION

- ASK TOBES:
is it necessary to send back JSON data on promises? is just the response object enough?
do I even need to convert my server.js to ES5?
some repetition in code (scope[index] stuff) ... is that ok?

- check cross-browser/device functionality
- make sure all questions are properly categorized


BIG PICTURE

- update dates across all mediums to list DC as completed Jan 2017 and include final project
